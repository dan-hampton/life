# Audio Assets for Hyper-Modern Game of Life

## Background Music (Task 48)

For the ambient background music, you need to source a high-quality, seamless, royalty-free ambient music loop. 

### Requirements:
- **Format**: MP3 or OGG
- **Duration**: 30 seconds to 2 minutes (will loop seamlessly)
- **Style**: Deep, ambient, meditative
- **Volume**: Should be subtle and non-distracting
- **Licensing**: Royalty-free or Creative Commons

### Recommended Sources:
1. **Pixabay Music** (https://pixabay.com/music/)
   - Free, royalty-free music
   - Good selection of ambient tracks
   - No attribution required for most tracks

2. **Freesound.org** (https://freesound.org)
   - Creative Commons licensed sounds
   - Check attribution requirements

3. **Zapsplat** (https://zapsplat.com)
   - Professional quality
   - Requires free account

### File Location:
Place your ambient music file at: `public/assets/audio/ambient-loop.mp3`

### Search Keywords:
- "ambient loop"
- "meditation music"
- "space ambient"
- "deep ambient"
- "atmospheric background"
- "cinematic ambient"

## Implementation Notes

The audio system is already implemented and will:
- Automatically load the file from `/assets/audio/ambient-loop.mp3`
- Loop the audio seamlessly
- Provide volume controls in the debug panel
- Only start playback after user interaction (browser policy compliance)
- Fall back to silent operation if no audio file is found

## Current Status

ðŸ”‡ **No audio file currently present** - The system will run with a silent placeholder until you add an ambient music file.

## Testing

1. Add your `ambient-loop.mp3` file to `public/assets/audio/`
2. Start the development server (`npm run dev`)
3. Click anywhere on the page to trigger audio initialization
4. Use the ðŸŽµ Music button in the debug panel to control playback
5. Adjust volume with the slider (default: 30%)
